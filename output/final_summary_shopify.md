Competitive Landscape:
Shopify operates in a competitive market with players like BigCommerce, Magento, and WooCommerce. However, Shopify's focus on ease-of-use and comprehensive solutions sets it apart.

Financial Projections:
The pitch deck does not provide financial projections. This is another area requiring due diligence to assess the company's financial health and future profitability.

Investment Ask & Use of Funds:
Shopify is seeking $25M in Series B funding for international expansion, product development, and team scaling.

Key Risks & Concerns:
Key risks include intense competition, reliance on the continued growth of e-commerce, and potential regulatory changes in the online commerce space. The lack of information about the founding team and financial projections are also concerns that need to be addressed.

Investment Recommendation:
Given Shopify's impressive traction, substantial market opportunity, and unique value proposition, it presents a compelling investment opportunity. However, due diligence is required to assess the founding team, financial projections, and potential risks.
